# Hami MiniMarket Inventory System

# Overview
The Hami MiniMarket Inventory System is a Python-based console application designed to help small shop owners or store managers track, organize, and manage their inventory efficiently.  
It allows users to add, update, delete, search, view, and export product data, all saved automatically to a CSV file for easy access in Excel or other spreadsheet tools.

This project was created as part of a Python Development Track, focusing on practical applications of file handling, loops, conditional logic, and clean code structuring.

# Idea Behind the Project
Small stores often rely on notebooks or memory to track stock, which leads to confusion, lost data, and inaccurate stock records.  
This system solves that by providing a simple, offline, and beginner-friendly inventory manager that:
- Keeps all products organized in one place.
- Automatically saves data to a file.
- Warns about low stock.
- Supports undoing accidental actions.
- Works perfectly on any computer with Python installed.

It‚Äôs built around clarity, reliability, and simplicity ‚Äî no databases, no installations, just Python and CSV.

# Features and Their Explanations

| Feature                           | Description                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  **Add Product**                  |Lets the user add new products (Name and Category required). Validates input for price and quantity. Prevents duplicates and offers to update if item exist|
|  **Update Product**               | Allows editing of any field (name, category, price, quantity). Blank fields mean ‚Äúno change.‚Äù Confirms before saving changes.|
|  **View Products**                | Displays all products neatly in table format, showing stock level indicators: üî¥ Low, üü° Moderate, üü¢ Good Stock. Also shows total count, quantity, and value.|
|  **Delete Product**               | Removes a product completely after confirmation. Can be undone later.                      |
|  **Search Product**               | Finds products by part of their name (case-insensitive search).                            |
|  **Calculate Total Value**        | Calculates total worth of all items in stock.                                              |
|  **Save & Load Data (CSV)**       | Automatically saves all products into a `inventory.csv` file and reloads them on next run. |
|  **Export to CSV**                | Lets user export the inventory into a different CSV file (e.g., `export_inventory.csv`).   |
|  **Undo Last Change**             | Reverts the last action (Add, Delete, or Update) to restore data easily.                   |
|  **Cancel Anytime**               | Typing `cancel` during any input safely returns to the menu without breaking anything.     |
|  **Stock Status Alerts**          | Items are categorized by quantity levels:- `< 20` ‚Üí üî¥ Low Stock - `20‚Äì99` ‚Üí üü° Moderate Stock - `‚â• 100` ‚Üí üü¢ Good Stock|
|  **Clean & Non-Repetitive Code**  | The code uses helper functions for validation, cancel checking, pausing, and stock-level evaluation ‚Äî making it easy to maintain and extend.|
